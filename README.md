=============================================================
Project II
In this document, all rules and requirements on how to proceed about defining and implement the Revature project II requirements are defined.
For this project, a different approach will be applied. You get to decide as a group, what are you going to work on. However, certain rules and requirements must be met.
Project Definition
In the other document, you will find a skeleton where you should:
-Name it as following: PROJECT_NAME [members initials separated by comma].
-Provide a project name and a brief description of your project (no more than four [4] lines).
-Define four (4) additional requirements on top of the mandatory ones.
---Note that there is one of the mandatories that you have to modify.
After the document is approved, you can proceed to add the defined requirements in Pivotal Tracker (add me as a member) and start working on your project.
The Project Definition should be done by the next day this document is presented.
General Rules
-Groups of three (3) or four (4) [if needed].
-Each group should have their project in one working pipeline.
-The project must be done completely. It must be clean, good looking, and user friendly.
-The security of your application is important.
-Have fun but keep it professional and think of this as your own product.
-Recommend you to not split work by layers. Work on requirements from front-to-back for full exposure in all technologies.
